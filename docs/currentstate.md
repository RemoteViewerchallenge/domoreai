ere is a summary of your entire system architecture, your core vision, and a list of medium-sized, bootstrapable coding tasks that your AI agents can execute to build the next layer.🧠 System Summary: The Multi-Agent Orchestration IDEYour project is a cutting-edge AI Agent Workforce Dashboard—a highly customized, typesafe IDE built to maximize the utility of free and rate-limited LLMs in a development workflow, aiming for 90% planning/design and 10% autonomous coding.ComponentStatusArchitectural RoleMonorepo StackTypeScript, React, Next.js, tRPC, pnpmProvides end-to-end type safety and efficient dependency management (atomic commits).Agent CoreVolcano.dev (Code Mode)Foundation for multi-agent workflows, utilizing LLMs to write TypeScript code (rather than contrived tool-calling syntax) to perform actions.VFS & Sandbox@jsvfs/core + /filesystem APIProvides the isolated execution fence and file persistence (the sandbox boundary). This abstracts local disk, S3, or SSH into a single, secure API.User InterfaceMonaco Editor GridThe central hub for context management and multi-model planning, acting as the Virtual Terminal and Versioned Filesystem.Model StrategyDatabase-First (with Role Creator and Model Manager soon)Systematically defines and matches model capabilities (parameters, scoring) to specific agent roles to optimize cost and performance ("maximize free labor").🎯 Future Vision: The Core LoopInput: Voice Speech-to-Text input initiates the design process.Orchestration & Planning: The Model Manager deploys multiple models simultaneously for research, summarization, and idea generation. Results are presented in the Monaco Grid for human selection.Human Feedback: The user selects/refines the best outputs in the editable Master Plan Monaco Editor.Final Execution: The refined plan (the 90% perfect design) is packaged with the Agent's specific Role and Workspace and handed to the Lootbox to generate and execute the final, small code blocks, often resulting in Git auto-commits.

⚙️ Next Steps: Bootstrap Coding Tasks for AI AgentsThese tasks are medium-sized, self-contained, and perfectly suited for your agents to execute in your existing monorepo structure. They focus on building the security, data, and communication layers needed to connect your frontend to your new VFS and Model management services.Task Set 1: Data Structures and Security Layer 

(Backend)TaskPackage/LocationCore Objective1. Create Agent Typespackages/commonDefine the TypeScript interfaces for the new agent system: Role, RoleParams, AgentSession, and VfsSessionToken. These types will enforce consistency across the entire monorepo.

2. Build VFS Security Layerapps/apiImplement the VfsSessionService using the @jsvfs/core you introduced. This service must generate and validate the short-lived, scoped VFS tokens linked to a user session.

3. Implement Git Client Wrapperapps/apiCreate a simple GitService module that wraps the git-client NPM package. Expose two tRPC-callable methods: gitCommit(path: string, message: string) and gitLog(path: string).

4. Setup Database Schemasapps/api (or dedicated module)Define the PostgreSQL schemas for the Role table and the ModelUsage table (to track provider usage and rate-limiting data for the future Model Manager).

Task Set 2: Communication and Persistence (Full Stack)TaskPackage/LocationCore Objective

5. Implement WebSocket Brokerapps/apiBuild the core WebSocket server logic (using ws or similar) and integrate it with an Express/tRPC route. The server needs to accept the vfsSessionToken for initial connection authorization.

6. Build Frontend WebSocket Clientapps/ui (Shared Hooks)Create a useWebSocket React hook that manages the persistent connection. This hook should send commands and process the streaming text output (stdout/stderr) from the backend.

7. Initial Monaco Componentapps/ui (Component)Create a TerminalLogViewer.tsx component. This component should display a read-only Monaco Editor and be fed the real-time stream of text from the WebSocket hook, simulating the terminal output.

8. VFS Text Presentationapps/ui (Component/Logic)Create the VfsTextPresenter utility. This function must take the raw JSON file list from the /filesystem API and generate the simple, Monaco-readable text format (e.g., the directory tree).

These eight tasks are designed to be built in parallel or sequence, immediately integrating the file system, security, and real-time communication into your existing monorepo framework.
