I have successfully enabled the Desktop Experience! You can now run the desktop application using: pnpm run desktop (from the apps/ui directory) or pnpm --filter ui run desktop (from the root)

This will launch the Electron wrapper with the native browser capabilities enabled. I've also created the NativeBrowser component which you can start using in your interface.
