<p>Task 1: The "Atomic" Refactor (System Architect)</p><p></p><p>Scan apps/ui/src/nebula/registry.tsx.</p><p></p><p>Action: Create apps/ui/src/components/nebula/primitives/Box.tsx and Text.tsx.</p><p></p><p>Constraint: Use the 9-line rule. Do not attempt to move everything at once. Update registry.tsx after each successful file write.</p><p></p><p>Task 2: Cognitive Recovery Protocol (UI Technologist)</p><p></p><p>Monitor for APIConnectionTimeoutError or ZodValidationError.</p><p></p><p>Action: If an error occurs, do NOT ask for human help. Instead, read the failed output, call the LLMSelector for a "High-Stability Fallback," and attempt to fix the propSchema in the new primitive file.</p><p></p><p>Task 3: Governance Filter (Governance Warden)</p><p></p><p>Update PropertyPanel.tsx to read the isHeadless flag from the registry.</p><p></p><p>Suppress any component marked hidden: true.</p><p></p><p>Protocol: All agents must use filesystem-mcp for hot-reloading. If a model fails twice on the same task, automatically delegate to the Recovery Agent to log the AST and suggest a simplified implementation.</p>
