 It seems like you're providing a set of instructions or steps for creating a new role called "Nebula DNA Architect". This role seems to be responsible for tasks involving TypeScript AST manipulation, Tailwind-to-Design-Token mapping, and decoupling implementation from schema in a file named "registry.tsx".

The tools that this role will have access to include the "filesystem" for file management, "uiArchitectTools" which likely refers to tools for UI architecture, and "search_codebase" for searching the codebase.
