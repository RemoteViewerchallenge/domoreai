 This plan appears to be a detailed implementation plan for a "Headless swarm" system. It involves various phases to optimize the system using Internal Protocol (MCP) and Native Services.

In Phase 1, the "Sentinel" is created as a deterministic baseline. This involves spawning a Sentinel agent with GIT and UI_ARCHITECT capabilities. The goal is to capture the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the "apps/ui/src/nebula/registry.tsx" file as a "Gold Standard" before any mutations.

In Phase 2, the "DNA" Extraction phase, the system utilizes the AstTransformer.ts service to migrate from hardcoded components to a data-driven manifest. This involves identifying repetitive Tailwind patterns and extracting them into a StyleTokens Zod schema.

In Phase 3, the "Ouroboros" phase, the SelfImprovementService.ts is "healed" to implement applyRefinements. This involves generating a dynamic manifest and replacing hardcoded imports in the registry.tsx file with a dynamic loader.

In Phase 4, the "Evolution Lab" phase, the EvolutionEngine runs a parallel parity test. This involves comparing the current Workbench with the Headless Meta-Registry and using a high-reasoning model to compare the screenshots of the two variants.

The Master Execution Chain is a hardened InstructionChain that the Master Orchestrator must execute to initiate the refactor. This involves executing the steps: sentinel, extractor, ouroboros, evaluator, and on failure, trigger_autonomic_rollback.

The Architect's Final Verdict states that the system is capable and the current tools should be used for AST Transformation and Architectural Logic, while the External CLI agents should be relegated to Infrastructure Workers. The next step is to proceed to Phase 1 and establish the Sentinel Baseline.
