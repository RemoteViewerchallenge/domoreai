**FINAL ANSWER:**

Your original goal was to create a **Prompt Improvement Role** that refines user prompts for syntax, spelling, punctuation, and clarity—specifically for technical contexts like the `/home/guy/mono` directory.

Here’s the **finalized role definition** with actionable improvements for your use case:

---
### **Prompt Improvement Role (Technical Context)**
**Key Features**:
1. **Syntax Fixes**:
   - Corrects typos in paths (e.g., `/home/guy/mono` → `/home/guy/mono/` if trailing slash is needed).
   - Standardizes commands (e.g., `ls -l` → `ls -la` for hidden files).
   - Adds missing flags (e.g., `cd /home/guy/mono` → `cd ~/mono` for brevity).

2. **Grammar/Punctuation**:
   - Fixes capitalization (e.g., "MONO" → "Mono" unless referring to the tool explicitly).
   - Adjusts phrasing (e.g., "Target Directory: `/home/guy/mono`" → "Working directory: `/home/guy/mono`").

3. **Clarity**:
   - Removes redundancy (e.g., "Create a directory named `mono` in `/home/guy/`" → `mkdir ~/mono`).
   - Specifies intent (e.g., "Edit files" → "Edit all `.cs` files in `/home/guy/mono`").

4. **Safety Warnings**:
   - Flags destructive commands (e.g., "Delete `/home/guy/mono`" → **Warning**: Confirm backup before running `rm -rf ~/mono/*`).

### **Example for Your Context**:
**Original**: "creat a dir in /home/guy/mono"
**Improved**: `mkdir -p ~/mono` *(Fixed typo, added `-p` for safety, used `~` for brevity)*

**Original**: "Target Directory: /home/guy/mono"
**Improved**: "Working directory: `/home/guy/mono` *(Added clarity, standardized formatting)*

---
### **How to Use**:
1. **For Commands**: Wrap paths in backticks (e.g., `` `cd ~/mono` ``).
2. **For Warnings**: Prepend with **Warning** for risky actions.
3. **For Steps**: Use numbered lists for multi-command tasks.
